            Greetings! My name is Enoka Patrick Silipa and this is my magnum
            opus, the crowning achievement I've concocted up these past two
            weeks. I've taken the front-end class before but I ended up taking a
            long break right after and almost lost a good chunk of my React.js
            knowledge. So here I am taking it again! Which is fine. Devpipeline
            is helping me become a developer, and I feel more confident every
            day! The hardest part for me—and I can only speak for myself because
            I'm not you *insert your name here* whoever you are reading this—has
            been spending a lot of time researching context and its purposes and
            integrating that with your components. Luckily, we are in my
            favorite languages of front-end: JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
